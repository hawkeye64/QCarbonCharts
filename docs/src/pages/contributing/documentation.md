You can contribute to the content on the QCharts site in a few different ways. Choose the way that works best for you.

## Editing pages

The easiest was to edit a page is with the ++Edit this page on GitHub++ link that appears on the bottom of almost all pages on this site. The link opens a specific GitHub page where you can edit the content and then propose the change with a Pull Request.

Alternatively, you can fork the QCharts repo, make your changes and generate a Pull Request.

## Using markdown

The site is written using a syntax called [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). If you are unfamiliar with this syntax, it is quite easily learned.

## Guidelines for writing content

Please keep this in mind when writing content for QCharts:

- Aim for a friendly tone and encouragement of others.
- Speak directly to the user. You can use the second person pronoun ("you").
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.
- Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text, the easier it is for all users to understand.
