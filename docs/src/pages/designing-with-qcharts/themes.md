Themes are an additional way for you to have control over the way your calendar looks. This is done with [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). CSS custom properties are part of modern web programming. For the most part, a lot of the CSS custom properties used by QCalendar are general in nature. Meaning, they are used by all calendar modes.

Most of the CSS custom properties are just for color (both background and text), while others are for borders with color, and some are for other miscellaneous, like width or font size. Out of the colored-based ones, they are in pairs: One for browser [Dark Mode](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) and the other for normal operational mode.

All the available properties are available in the [Theme Builder](/theme-builder).

The Theme Builder editors know what should be edited, but they don't prevent you from making errors or mistakes in design. For instance, one thing you can do but may have undesirable results is if you change border widths. This is not recommended.
