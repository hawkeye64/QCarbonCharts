For keyboard navigation use the `use-navigation` property along with the `focusable` and `focus-type` properties.

When the calendar has focus use the <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>&larr;</kbd>, <kbd>&rarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd> and , <kbd>End</kbd>keys.

You can also use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> for regular browser navigation.
