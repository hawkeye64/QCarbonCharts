This example uses the `use-navigation` property along with the `focusable` and `focus-type` properties.

If the calendar has focus you can use the <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> keys on your keyboard for navigation.

On the intervals, you can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> for navigation.
