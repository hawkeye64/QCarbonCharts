You can specify the `cell-width` property to make your calendar overrun it's horizontal boundaries.

The calendar goes into a special `sticky` mode when this happens so you can scroll vertically and/or horizontally.

<example-viewer
  title="Cell Width"
  file="WeekCellWidth"
  codepen-title="QCalendarDay"
/>
